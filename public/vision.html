For this to happen, each individual must go deep within themselves and develop an emotional capacity to create deep bonds with themselves, with one another and the universe at large. This is how “beauty in character” is created. Our deep bonds are what enable us to scale as a society and evolve from a tribe to a civilization. This conveys the essence and importance of the process of emotional development. Today, we as a society seem to have missed out on emotional well-being at large.

This pushed our society into bloody conflicts that were finally resolved with the separation of “Church and State” and the birth of Nation States. As Religions evolved into Nation States they also took over every aspect of our society. While this worked well for providing basic material welfare and individual liberties, <em>the </em><em>church</em><em>-state divide missed out on Emotional Well-Being</em>. The church took care of the essential spiritual development within individuals that Nation States could not compensate for.

A territory whose wealth has been drained by Colonialism would view Capitalism in a negative light and choose Socialism or Communism to ensure there is an equitable distribution of wealth. A territory with vast amounts of resources and a handful of people would prefer Capitalism to maximize individual potential. Ideologies are often a reflection of circumstances. In Network States we can build from scratch and give people the choice to take part in certain circumstances or experiments . This makes it favorable to create multiple trajectories and give people the choice to take part in one or more of them simultaneously. </p><p id="1bcf59bf-9980-476c-a8eb-de80f98e7e36" class="">circumstance/</p><p id="9dd76c6d-db56-4223-88c6-aa6b95e599dd" class="">Dharmic Creativism believes that any problem can have multiple possible solutions and advocates simultaneous implementation of multiple creative solutions as long as they represent deeper alignment towards “Dharma”. The NES would support this by enabling each sub-society to operate on their own creative solutions simultaneously. An individual can choose to opt-in or opt-out of any of these sub-societies instead of having a single blanket solution for everyone. </p><p id="d632cb6b-39c3-4826-8d6f-29132fa78269" class=""> </p><p id="fb36f5dd-bebe-4c49-a626-ae57d8f71d02" class=""><span style="border-bottom:0.05em solid"><strong>Dynamic Governance</strong></span></p><p id="094e93f7-78dd-45c5-b695-b1d4d08bc065" class="">

Such a system minimizes the time between ideation and manifestation, enabling new ideas to become a ground reality in much shorter time-spans. This needs to go hand in hand with an ideology that supports such dynamic cycles of ideation and manifestation. Creativism defines that a solution must always be rethought from first principles as per the change in circumstances.  Applying 19th-century law to 21st-century circumstances is not the ideal way to deal with problems. Emphasis on “Dharma” ensures that any new solution is intended to create positive outcomes for our society. This makes “Dharmic Creativism” a very compatible ideology for Dynamic Governance through DAOs.</p><p id="abdbc7a5-10a1-448a-8585-1e37307a639f" class="">

This dynamic combination of technocracy, direct and representative democracy is called a Liquid democracy as the nature of democracy is constantly evolving with changing circumstances. The Indians used a wheel to represent Dharma as a wheel keeps changing its position to make room for new ground and take the vehicle forward. Ancient India had Dharma at the heart of any governance mechanism and manifested different governance structures as per changing environments. Dharmic Creativism is an attempt to revive this approach of not believing in a “One size fits all” solution like some of the other ideologies. The only thing that must remain constant is the alignment towards Dharma. </p></div></p><p id="c6eb91da-7b7f-4bdc-b01a-61a5b446cdb2" class="">
