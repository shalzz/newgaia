Principles are fundamental, universal truths that transcend time, geography,
culture and context.
These principles are not aspirations, they are constraints; we expect them to
be the marrow of all members and adhered to under all conditions.

### Integrity

Principles are meaningless without the integrity to uphold them; we view our
integrity as our single-most important principle. We do not sacrifice our
principles for expediency or comfort.

### Honesty

We seek and tell the truth, even where those truths are painful or
inconvenient. We abide by the spirit of the truth, not merely its letter; we
do not hide falsehoods in language that is technically true or otherwise
misleading.

### Decency

We treat others with dignity, be they colleague, customer, community or
competitor.
