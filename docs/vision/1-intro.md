# The Vision üåå

To build a new Economic, Cultural, and Technological Foundation for our civilization
that brings prosperity to each individual and enables them to develop deep emotional
bonds with one another and hence the universe at large.

## Prosperity

Prosperity is the state of constantly growing and flourishing in all aspects of life:

Any well-intended society is built to bring prosperity to all its members.
However, none of the existing Nation States have come close to becoming prosperous in all aspects. For example,

- Bhutan is emotionally prosperous, but it has stagnated in material and cultural terms.
- Scandinavian countries to a good extent are prosperous in material and emotional terms but stagnate in cultural terms.
- Japan,USA and China are prosperous in material and cultural terms but lack emotional prosperity.

Lack of prosperity in one aspect eventually impacts other aspects too:

1. Material: *Wealth, Physical Wellbeing*

2. Emotional: *Mental Health, Sense of Purpose/Identity, Companionship, Freedom of Speech/Expression*

3. Cultural: *Flourishing Innovation/Arts/Science, Positive Group Dynamics, Healthy and Evolving Traditions*

## Origins of Nation State

Early civilizations used religion as their foundation. Religious authorities were
in charge of all aspects of a society (Economics, Culture, Progress).
Over time however, these religious authorities lost ingenuity and became motivated by personal gains.
This pushed our society into bloody conflicts that were finally resolved with the
separation of ‚ÄúThe Church and The State‚Äù and the birth of Nation States.
As Religions evolved into Nation States they also took over every aspect of our society.
While this worked well for providing basic material welfare and individual liberties,
*the church-state divide missed out on Emotional Well-Being*.

The Church or the priest gave the people something higher than themselves the
people could work and aspire towards, something that Nation States today have
a glaring lack of, leading to people becoming cynical, isolated and
competitive.

### Lack of Emotional Well-Being

Nation States were never built to take emotional welfare into account.
Political Economies measure economic progress by metrics like ‚ÄúGDP‚Äù, ‚ÄúPer Capita Income‚Äù and ‚ÄúPurchasing Power‚Äù.

Even the "Happiness Index" of Bhutan is built on indicators of material progress.
It's not a surprise that we live in an emotionally fractured society.

### Economies are built on Scarcity

Furthermore, these economies are built on some form of scarcity bound to a
State‚Äôs ‚ÄúNational Reserves‚Äù. Control of these reserves is restricted to a few elites.
This leads to the concentration of wealth in the hands of a select few ‚Äòelites‚Äô
to govern the mass populace creating an eternal cycle of resource scarcity, bureaucratic corruption, and an inefficient system.

We propose the following major changes in the way political economy functions today:

1. Bringing emotional welfare to the core of our society alongside material progress. Any progress must represent all aspects of prosperity. New metrics of ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô need to be calibrated.

2. A new kind of Economics must be invented that works on abundance instead of scarcity.

Both of these are massive problems and have remained unsolved. To solve these problems we will use a combination of Creative Economy and Web3 to invent a [new kind of political economy.](/vision/dharmic-creativism)

*New Gaia State will demonstrate how we can build new political economies that place emotional development at the core of economic progress.*
