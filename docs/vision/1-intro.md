#  👼 The Vision

To build a new foundation (Economic, Cultural, and Technological) for our civilization that brings prosperity to each individual and enables them to develop deep emotional bonds with one another and the universe at large.

## Prosperity for All!

> Prosperity is the state of constantly growing and flourishing in all aspects of life:
> 
> **1. Material:** *Wealth, Physical Wellbeing*
> 
> **2. Emotional:** *Mental Health, Sense of Purpose/Identity, Companionship, Freedom of Speech/Expression*
> 
> **3. Cultural:** *Flourishing Innovation/Arts/Science, Positive Group Dynamics, Healthy and Evolving Traditions*

Any well-intended society is built to bring prosperity to all its members. Our world today uses Nation States as a unit of organization for the global order. Every society today finds its roots in a Nation State. A Nation State uses a Constitution as a guiding document for itself and all societies within it. The Constitution captures aspects of prosperity through its fundamental rights. However, very few Nation States have come close to becoming prosperous in all aspects. For example,

- Bhutan is emotionally prosperous, but it has stagnated in material and cultural terms.

- Scandinavian countries to a good extent are prosperous in material and emotional terms but stagnate in cultural terms.

- Japan/USA are prosperous in material and cultural terms but lack emotional prosperity.

Lack of prosperity in one aspect eventually impacts other aspects too.

## Economy 2.0: Integrating Emotional Welfare Into Material Progress

Peace can exist in the world only when each individual develops a sense of righteousness within themselves. For this to happen, each individual must go deep within themselves and develop an emotional capacity to create deep bonds with themselves, with one another and the universe at large. This is how “beauty in character” is created. Our deep bonds are what enable us to scale as a society and evolve from a tribe to a civilization. This conveys the essence and importance of the process of emotional development. Today, we as a society seem to have missed out on emotional well-being at large. The root cause of this problem lies in the very nature of Nation States.

## Origins of Nation State

Early civilizations used religion as their foundation. Religious authorities were in charge of all aspects of a society (Economics, Culture, Progress). Over time, these religious authorities lost ingenuity and became motivated by personal gains. This pushed our society into bloody conflicts that were finally resolved with the separation of “Church and State” and the birth of Nation States. As Religions evolved into Nation States they also took over every aspect of our society. While this worked well for providing basic material welfare and individual liberties, *the church-state divide missed out on Emotional Well-Being*. The church took care of the essential spiritual development within individuals that Nation States could not compensate for. This is how we lost out on emotional welfare.

### Lack of Emotional Well-Being

Nation States were never built to take emotional welfare into account. Political Economies measure economic progress by metrics like “GDP”, “Per Capita Income” and “Purchasing Power”. Even the so-called “Happiness Index” is built on indicators of material progress. It's not a surprise that we live in an emotionally fractured society.

### Economies are built on Scarcity

Furthermore, these economies are built on some form of scarcity bound to a State’s “National Reserves”. Control of these reserves is restricted to a few elites. This leads to the concentration of wealth in the hands of a select few ‘elites’ to govern the mass populace creating an eternal cycle of resource scarcity, bureaucratic corruption, and an inefficient system.

We propose the following major changes in the way political economy functions today:

1. Bringing emotional welfare to the core of our society alongside material progress. Any progress must represent all aspects of prosperity. New metrics of ‘development’ need to be calibrated.

2. A new kind of Economics must be invented that works on abundance instead of scarcity.

Both of these are massive problems and have remained unsolved. To solve these problems we will use a combination of Creative Economy and Web3 to invent a [new kind of political economy.](/vision/dharmic-creativism)

*New Gaia State will demonstrate how we can build new political economies that place emotional development at the core of economic progress.*
