# The Vision üåå

To build a new Economic, Cultural, and Technological Foundation for our civilization
that brings prosperity to each individual and enables them to develop deep emotional
bonds with one another and hence the universe at large.

## Prosperity

Prosperity is the state of constantly growing and flourishing in all aspects of life:

Any well-intended society is built to bring prosperity to all its members.
However, none of the existing Nation States have come close to becoming prosperous in all aspects. For example,

- Bhutan is emotionally prosperous, but it has stagnated in material and cultural terms.
- Scandinavian countries to a good extent are prosperous in material and emotional terms but stagnate in cultural terms.
- Japan,USA and China are prosperous in material and cultural terms but lack emotional prosperity.

Lack of prosperity in one aspect eventually impacts other aspects too:

1. Material: *Wealth, Physical Wellbeing*

2. Emotional: *Mental Health, Sense of Purpose/Identity, Companionship, Freedom of Speech/Expression*

3. Cultural: *Flourishing Innovation/Arts/Science, Positive Group Dynamics, Healthy and Evolving Traditions*

## Origins of Nation State

Early civilizations used religion as their foundation. Religious authorities were
in charge of all aspects of a society (Economics, Culture, Progress).
Over time however, these religious authorities lost ingenuity and became motivated by personal gains.
This pushed our society into bloody conflicts that were finally resolved with the
separation of ‚ÄúThe Church and The State‚Äù and the birth of Nation States.
As Religions evolved into Nation States they also took over every aspect of our society.
While this worked well for providing basic material welfare and individual liberties,
*the church-state divide missed out on Emotional Well-Being*.

The Church or the priest gave the people something higher than themselves the
people could work and aspire towards, something that Nation States today have
a glaring lack of, leading to people becoming cynical, isolated and
competitive.

### Metrics of Progress and Evolution

Political Economies measure only economic and capitalistic progress via metrics
like ‚ÄúGDP‚Äù, ‚ÄúPer Capita Income‚Äù and ‚ÄúPurchasing Power‚Äù.

The Bhutanese [Gross National Happiness][1] or the "Happiness Index" comes close to
being a more holistic approach to development and social welfare. However
it doesn't completely capture the human emotional development and overall
growth of it's citizens.

When look and moving towards [Dharmic Capitalism][2] there's still a need for a
metric or an index that can truly guide us and measure our impact and
progress across all aspects of life and society that are good and just.

To do so we look at the philosophy of Dharma and how we can encapsulate some
of it's impact and ideals into a modern way of collecting, computing and
presenting.

We need a Dharmic Index, a metric that measures progress and interdependence
across different aspect such as:

* Material Comfort
* Physical Health
* Emotional Maturity and Intelligence
* Ecological sustainability
* Environmental diversity and harmony

A Dharmic Index, that places equal value on all these aspect of an individuals
life, can be the only true measure of a societies progress and development.
