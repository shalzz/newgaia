# Succeeding Nation States 🏴‍☠️

NGC is not the first to think of creating a “New World” that brings back
emotional welfare into the big picture. Let's study the possible approaches to
creating new societies and examples for each of them.

## Past Approaches and the Road Ahead

One approach is to set up **New Nation States** that bring back emotional
development into the foundation of our society. This was the approach taken by
visionaries like Sri Aurobindo-Mirra Alfassa (Auroville) and Rajneesh (OSHO
Oregon City). These unfortunately could not scale beyond their regions and
often got into conflicts with Nation States. Due to their commune-like nature,
they could not get sovereign recognition and evolve into full-fledged Nation
States.

The second approach is to establish **Global Societies** in existing nation
states and enforce new ways of living within these societies. This is the
approach taken by most religious organizations or alternative living movements
around the world. Some successful examples include the Theosophical Society
(Madame Blavatsky - Colonel Olcott), Art of Living (Sri Sri Ravishankar), etc.
These have sustained but utilize economic systems and culture of Nation States
they reside in. This prevents them from providing an alternative foundation
for our civilization and solving problems inherent to their respective Nation
States.

For New Gaia State to function independently and scale globally without
friction from the existing order of Nation States it is important for them to
disconnect from Nation States at both economic and decision-making levels.

The web3 movement has given a third alternative in the form of **“Network
States”**. This is a combination of the first two approaches. Network States
use blockchain technology to construct independent economic systems without
reliance on any of the existing Nation States. This allows any collective to
evolve into a [parallel
society](https://thenetworkstate.com/the-one-commandment#the-concept-of-a-parallel-society)
without creating conflicts with the existing establishment. Here we combine
the best parts from Nation States and Global Societies without their
limitations.

### Building a Network State

The sequence of steps involved in the [creation of a Network
State](https://thenetworkstate.com/on-network-states#path-to-the-network-state)
are as follows:

1. **Network Union**

A network union is an online community aligned over a common interest with a
capacity for collective action. These are typically organized in a social tree
structure, to enforce a structure in governance. The network union engages in
collective action on behalf of its members.

2. **Network archipelago**

A network union that begins acquiring and networking properties in the
physical world. The **physical interaction** is key for building trust.

3. **Network State**

A network archipelago that gains diplomatic recognition from at least one
legacy state. The diplomatic recognition is key for attaining sovereignty.

## Network States and DAOs

While Network States have shown an additional way to organize the global
order, they fail to answer questions around “how we can govern ourselves?”. To
understand how we can govern ourselves better, let us first examine the roots
of inefficiency in existing systems.

### Why Are Existing Systems Inefficient?

1. **Regionality**

Most systems that we use for governance were designed in an era before the
internet (or communications technologies in general). In the pre-internet era,
collective decision-making required individuals to be present together in a
single location to engage in debate and discussions. This made any democratic
decision-making very inefficient. The advent of the internet enables
individuals to get into discussions irrespective of their geographical
location.

2. **Representative Democracies Are Slow**

Democracy is supposed to be a form of governance that is “By the People, for
the People”. However, as the population of a democracy increases it becomes
very difficult to coordinate among them and hence “Representative Democracies”
are born. The mass populace elects a small group of people to represent them
and make decisions on their behalf. These elected representatives however need
to continuously appease their voter base to stay in power. Therefore, in
practice, a lot of time goes into appeasement than constructive governance.
Modern Technologies like AI and Blockchain are now ripe to enable aspects of
“Direct Democracy” where people can directly participate in decision-making
without the need for any representatives. “Representative Democracy” can be
limited to decisions that need expert consensus. This combination of Direct
and Representative is what we call [“Liquid
Democracy”](https://www.cryptoaltruism.org/blog/liquid-democracy-the-future-of-governance-powered-by-blockchain).

3. **Colonial Law Was Never Built to Scale**

Our world is still run by colonial legal and judiciary systems that carry vast
amounts of inertia. These systems were never built to serve the mass populace
due to their excessively centralized and bureaucratic nature. Making new
laws/policies and implementing them is very inefficient and time-consuming in
these systems. This also makes any reform unlikely due to the large gap
between ideation and manifestation. Web3 through the use of Smart Contracts
offers a good antidote to this legislative inertia. It also opens up the
possibility of a reliable [Decentralized Judiciary](https://kleros.io/) that
can offer an alternative to today’s clunky justice system.

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

> DAOs a*llows us to design a new form of democracy which is more stable, less
> prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens,
> and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality
> decisions*  *— Tony Blaire Institute for Global Change*

A Decentralized Autonomous organization or DAO is a collectively-owned,
blockchain-governed organization working towards a shared mission.

DAOs allow us to work with like-minded folks around the globe without trusting
a benevolent leader to manage the funds or operations. There is no CEO who can
spend funds on a whim or CFO who can manipulate the books. Instead,
blockchain-based rules baked into the code define how the organization works
and how funds are spent.

DAOs offer an internet-native approach to governing communities. This
organizational model promises to replace deadlocked and corrupt governments.
DAOs enable a “liquid democracy” — an optimal blend of representative
democracy and direct democracy that can be applied at scale. No longer will
citizens need to place trust in a an elected representative politician to
represent their best interests or have to worry about popular legislation
being blocked from a vote; instead, the DAO’s code automatically enacts the
majority view of its members.

### subDAOs

A subDAO is an approach to addressing the operational challenge of delegating
responsibility within a DAO — without sacrificing decentralization. SubDAOs
have an independent foundation and ownership structure but use their parent
DAO as an economic and ideological base. Any Tokenomics in subDAOs ties back
to their parent DAO’s Tokens.

## New Gaia State, its Sub-Societies and Forks

The NGC would work towards the development of its first Network State in the
form of **New Gaia State (NES)** that will act as a foundation for other
**Sub-Societies** to emerge out of them.

The subDAOs in New Gaia State will form their own Sub-Societies around
themselves but the sovereign recognition would stay with New Gaia State.

*New Gaia State will scale by enabling sub-societies to emerge and function
within its Infrastructure (Technological, Economic and Cultural).*

### New Gaia State

New Gaia State or NES is going to be the heart and soul of NGC’s agenda. Its
aim is to bring back aspects of emotional development to the core of our
society that we missed out on when we transitioned into Nation States. Any new
world order is created on a concrete foundation that offers Cultural,
Economic, Technological, and Spiritual Leadership. NES is going to be an
initiation for a new world order built on Network States.

### Sub-Societies and Derived Network States

*NGC through its human development programs will empower individuals to become
creators in their own right and start their own Sub-Societies within the
sovereignty of the New Gaia State.*

Each of these sub-societies will operate independently via a subDAO with the
NGC DAO being its parent. Doing this ensures a stable backbone economy while
giving sufficient room for experimentation and decentralized growth. These
Sub-Societies will inherit aspects of culture, technology, and economy from
the New Gaia State and gradually evolve into independent societies with
sovereign recognition. This is when they would have an option to transition
into an independent network state.

Parent Network State → New Gaia State → NGC DAO

Sub-Societies → subDAO

Derived Network States(evolve out of Sub-Societies) → Independent Sovereign
Societies

### Forks

The NGC by design will open-source the majority of its technology
infrastructure. This might inspire several project ‘forks’ around the globe
for a variety of use cases, some of which might involve the creation of
Network States. While the NGC is not going to be directly involved in these
fork projects, we recognize and encourage them in building a new global order
that brings prosperity to all of us, in addition to us.
