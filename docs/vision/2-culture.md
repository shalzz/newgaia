# Culture üïå

> Culture can be defined as **all the ways of life including arts, beliefs and institutions of a population that are passed down from generation to generation**. Culture has been called *"the way of life for an entire society.‚Äù*

While economic systems determine incentive mechanisms in a society, our culture defines how we interact with one another and the environment around us. Culture is also responsible for setting up mechanisms through which we pass down our behavioral patterns from generation to generation. Even if we as a society manage to become prosperous in all its aspects, our culture would determine if we can persist prosperity across generations.

Culture can be understood by segregating it into various aspects:

1. **Social Dynamics** captures our behavior towards each other as individuals and also as a group.

2. **Design of Institutions** that we as a society use to govern ourselves and propagate values across generations.

3. Our shared sense of **Beliefs and Identity** that forms the foundation of our participation in Social Dynamics and Institutions.

## Social Dynamics

All of us have certain inner motivations that control our behavior towards other individuals and together as a group. Some of these motives come from immediate needs like hunger, material greed or have their origin in perennial needs like one‚Äôs sense of ethics or aesthetics.

### Basic Motives

All of us have certain needs stemming out of our very existence as biological beings. This takes the form of hunger, material needs, sexual desires, etc. These are temporal (short-lived), in a state of constant flux and often link themselves to some form of scarcity. Scarcity leads to a sense of insecurity that often manifests in the form of fear, anger, greed, lust, and hatred. Any group dynamic built on basic motives is quick to gain traction but is often short-lived and unable to scale beyond a certain limit due to the very nature of these motives. Most economic and political movements today are built on basic motives. This leads to a highly polarized and competitive world.

### Evolved Motives

There are certain needs that push us beyond our biological nature. These are perennial, often originating from our shared sense of beauty(i.e. aesthetics) and righteousness (i.e. ethics). Love, compassion, empathy, sense of purpose are some of the ways in which evolved motives manifest. These emotions have an aspect of abundance to them. Any group dynamic built on evolved motives requires a much stronger alignment amongst individuals and is initially slow to build. But once built these group dynamics are fast to gain traction and have no limits to their scale. Any social movement, art, literature, or science stemming out of evolved motives outlives its creators and is unshaken by time.

Most group dynamics be it Religious, Political, or Economic have elements of both basic and evolved motives in them. For any healthy culture to flourish it must anchor itself on evolved motives. This can happen only when institutions and individuals shaping a culture foster healthy integration of evolved motives and basic motives. *New Gaia State would fuel its social dynamics by constantly enabling individuals to tune into their evolved motives.*

## Design of Institutions

Culture often spreads through a society and propagates across generations via institutions that represent it. Institutions enforce governance mechanisms to maintain order in a society and reinforce its evolved motives using soft power. Soft power is grown by encouraging the development and spread of arts, literature and sciences. It is therefore very important for us to design our institutions correctly. Despite living in the 21st century most of us are still governed by institutions designed towards the end of the [feudal era](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-herkimer-westerncivilization/chapter/feudalism/#:~:text=Feudalism%20was%20a%20set%20of,exchange%20for%20service%20or%20labour.) (14th Century) during Church-State separation. It is about time we redesign our governance institutions to become more dynamic.

### Overcoming Outdated Institutions

Historically institutions often start with the right intent but decline over time. While bad leadership is one of the reasons for decline, they often deteriorate due to rusty bureaucracy that fails to catch up with rapidly changing environments. Bureaucratic inertia finds its roots in democracy, regionality, and subsequent centralization. Consequently, a lot of irrelevant organizational inertia propagates across time as dogmas and outdated policies. This is how values are lost across generations. Values are not destroyed but often fail to reinvent with times. **It's time we use our technological and social progress to redesign our institutions**. [Network States and DAOs](/vision/network-states) provide good design inspiration for new-age institutions. *New Gaia State takes design inspiration from Network States and the web3 movement at large.*

## Belief and Identity

We often start connecting with certain ideas and identities even before we fully understand them. If an individual believes in certain evolved motivations he will gradually also start embodying them. Providing belief-based pathways that enable individuals to go deeper within themselves to expand their identities is integral to building an inclusive and expansive culture. That is how belief translates into knowing. This is how the mass populace align themselves with evolved motivations beneath a culture.

Fostering group dynamics through events, workshops, and seminars is a great way to enable individuals to strengthen their belief in evolved motivations into knowing. This also helps build a good culture by setting the stage for the right kind of social dynamics. *Workshops, events, and mentorship programs are going to be a key aspect of New Gaia State. This would enable its participants to strengthen their beliefs in their motives and help uncover a larger identity for themselves.*

### Evolved Humans for an Evolved Society

Our society is only as good as the individuals who take part in it. Building new economic and cultural frameworks can work only when we as humans are evolved enough to participate in them. History is filled with countless examples of ideas failing due to people not being ready for them. Any drastic change in global systems must go hand in hand with an equally big transformation in individuals who take part in them.

Personal transformation journeys always *begin* by creating a healthy **Relationship with Self** and *end* with a healthy integration into society. This is how an individual establishes a positive **Relationship with Society**.

#### Relationship with Self

No individual with an unhealthy relationship with oneself is capable of creating a healthy society. An individual‚Äôs **Relationship with Self** determines their relationships with everything and everyone in general. This shapes our culture and also manifests how products, services, technology, systems, and organizations are created and maintained.

All of us live by certain beliefs, values, and certain gifts and pains. We are not only an expression of biological evolution but also an expression of all that we have gone through individually, socially, and collectively.

##### Acceptance of our Identities

Our journey towards acceptance of our identities begins with cultivating a sense of awareness towards our life. As we examine our strengths-weaknesses, and accept our basic-evolved motives we can gradually mature into a life of fulfillment. We are a product of our pasts and carry strong emotions around a variety of experiences that have shaped our lives. An honest examination of these emotions is a necessary step towards acceptance of our identities. It is through our emotions that we connect with one another and build healthy relationships with our surroundings. Once we are in tune with our emotions and have fully accepted our identities we arrive at fulfillment. Only a fulfilled individual can live in gratitude and compassion towards oneself and those around them. Only those with happiness and fulfilment inside can create things, products, technologies etc which brings happiness and fulfilment to others. Happiness and bliss breeds more happiness and bliss; and vice-versa.

##### Self-Love &amp; Self-Worth

How we treat ourselves is a cornerstone of how we treat the world. Our relationship with ourselves determines our relationship with the world. We must therefore learn to love ourselves before we can love others and our society as a whole. *‚ÄúLoving Ourselves‚Äù is what we call *‚Äúself-love‚Äù** and acts as *an important step towards unleashing our* ***‚Äúself-worth‚Äù***. Individuals with high self-worth derive their personal value from their underlying identity that lies beyond their past experiences and associated traumas. When individuals bury their true identity underneath their fears, anxieties, and other traumas they live in scarcity. By accepting our true identity we live in fulfillment and all our outlooks have an essence of abundance attached to them. At a collective level when each of us unleashes our self-worth we create a secure and abundant society.

*Personal and Emotional Development is therefore going to be the cornerstone of any of NGC‚Äôs initiatives.*

#### Relationship with Society

When we as individuals form a collective to coordinate various activities we create a society. Our behavior towards one another within a society is a function of our individual value systems and also the pre-existing ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù. By developing ourselves emotionally we also contribute to the development of the society at large. While this journey is always going to be an ongoing process it reaches a culmination when we discover roles in society that are an externalization of our self-worth.

##### Developing Value Systems

Every activity in a society has a certain direction to itself. This direction is often a reflection of our collective values as a society. Any collective is a sum of the individuals that make it. Therefore, to have strong value systems as a society it is important for us to have coherent value systems at an individual level. Our high ‚Äúself-worth‚Äù that we cultivate through our pursuit of ‚Äúself-love‚Äù must translate into value systems at a societal level. When we have strong value systems built on a sense of abundance our actions also imbibe similar values amongst others in the society. This ensures that even when we as a society lose a sense of direction our value systems put us back on track. *The NGC is committed to enabling each individual to develop strong value systems for themselves and their environment at large. This ensures that the NES is not dependent on a handful of individuals for its sense of direction.*

##### Order as a Reflection of Our Values

All of us are subject to various ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù systems as per the immediate environment that we live in. Any ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù is also a reflection of underlying values that a society had at some point in time when these books were written. As individuals, we constantly evolve our values as a consequence of our inner journeys toward understanding our true identities. This evolution of values might move much faster than what is reflected in the current day‚Äôs ‚ÄúLaw and Order‚Äù. Here it becomes important for us to build institutions that can enable us to evolve our ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù as per the constant development of our values. *The NGC aims to use the NES as an example of how our ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù can also evolve as we as individuals evolve.*

##### Integrating Into the Society

*We believe that each individual who takes up their emotional development journey has a role to play in NES.* The NES through its sub-societies provides sufficient options for contribution and development. As individuals develop themselves they become capable of bringing something unique into our world. The NES offers its complete support to such individuals by enabling them to build communities and economies around their unique ideas. This is the core strategy through which the NES aims to scale its society and associated economy.

## Putting Things Together

To bring prosperity, the New Gaia State (NES) aims to build a new culture and a new economy "New Gaia Economy" that places emotional development at its core and works on abundance. In doing so we:

1. Nurture an intimate community of individuals that work towards embodying NGC‚Äôs vision.

2. Ensure each of NGC‚Äôs member satisfy their own needs around growth and survival to feel fulfilled both economically and emotionally. The expansion of an ecosystem should never come at the cost of one‚Äôs health and values. This is the only way the NGC can build and retain the capacity to offer emotional development services across the globe.

3. Nurture human capital that is capable of leading and participating in various sub-societies within the New Gaia State(NES).

4. Re-invent our institutions. We move away from centralized organizational design and take inspiration from the [DAO model](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/). In doing so we also provide the means for global order to succeed from [Nation States to Network States](https://thenetworkstate.com/).

5. Utilize Creative Economy as a framework to build new political economies that can measure and incentivize emotional development alongside material progress.

6. Provide the necessary infrastructure (Technology, Economy, and Culture) for multiple sub-societies to emerge within NES and operate on their specialized domain of creative assets.

7. Utilize NES and its sub-societies as a means to create prosperity globally in all its aspects: Material, Emotional, and Cultural.
