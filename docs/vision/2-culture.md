# Culture ðŸ•Œ

:::info
Culture can be defined as **all the ways of life including arts, beliefs and
institutions of a population that are passed down from generation to
generation**.[^1]
:::

While economic systems determine incentive mechanisms in a society, our
culture defines how we interact with one another and the environment around
us. Culture is also responsible for setting up mechanisms through which we
pass down our behavioral patterns from generation to generation. Even if we as
a society manage to become prosperous in all its aspects, our culture would
determine if we can persist prosperity across generations.

Culture can be understood by segregating it into various aspects:

1. **Social Dynamics** captures our behavior towards each other as individuals
and also as a group.

2. **Design of Institutions** that we as a society use to govern ourselves and
propagate values across generations.

3. Our shared sense of **Beliefs and Identity** that forms the foundation of
our participation in Social Dynamics and Institutions.

## Social Dynamics

All of us have certain inner motivations that control our behavior towards
other individuals and together as a group. Some of these motives come from
immediate needs like hunger, material greed or have their origin in perennial
needs like oneâ€™s sense of ethics or aesthetics.

### Basic Motives

All of us have certain needs stemming out of our existence as biological
beings. This takes the form of hunger, material needs, sexual desires, etc.
These are temporal (short-lived), in a state of constant flux and often link
themselves to some form of scarcity. Scarcity leads to a sense of insecurity
that often manifests in the form of fear, anger, greed, lust, and hatred. Any
group dynamic built on basic motives is quick to gain traction but is often
short-lived and unable to scale beyond a certain limit due to the nature
of these motives. Most economic and political movements today are built on
basic motives. This leads to a highly polarized and competitive world.

### Higher Motives

There are certain needs that push us beyond our biological nature. These are
perennial, often originating from our shared sense of beauty (i.e. aesthetics)
and righteousness (i.e. ethics). Love, compassion, empathy, sense of purpose
are some of the ways in which higher motives manifest. These emotions have an
aspect of abundance to them. Any group dynamic built on higher motives
requires a much stronger alignment amongst individuals and is initially slow
to build. But once built these group dynamics are fast to gain traction and
have no limits to their scale. Any social movement, art, literature, or
science stemming out of higher motives outlives its creators and is unshaken
by time.

Most group dynamics be it Religious, Political, or Economic have elements of
both basic and higher motives in them. For any healthy culture to flourish it
must anchor itself on higher motives. This happens only when institutions
and individuals shaping a culture foster healthy integration of higher
motives and basic motives.

## Design of Institutions

Culture often spreads through a society and propagates across generations via
institutions that represent it. Institutions enforce governance mechanisms to
maintain order in a society and reinforce its higher motives using soft
power. Soft power is grown by encouraging the development and spread of arts,
literature and sciences. It is therefore important for us to design our
institutions correctly. Despite living in the 21st century most of us are
still governed by institutions designed towards the end of the [feudal era][1]
(14th Century) during Church-State separation.

### Overcoming Outdated Institutions

Historically institutions often start with the right intent but decline over
time. While bad leadership is one of the reasons for decline, they often
deteriorate due to rusty bureaucracy that fails to catch up with rapidly
changing environments. Bureaucratic inertia finds its roots in democracy,
regionality, and subsequent centralization. Consequently, a lot of irrelevant
organizational inertia propagates across time as dogmas and outdated policies.
This is how values are lost across generations. Values are not destroyed but
often fail to reinvent with times. **We live in a time where we can use our technological and
social progress to redesign our institutions**. [Network States and
DAOs](/vision/network-states) provide a good design inspiration for new-age
institutions.

## Belief and Identity

We often start connecting with certain ideas and identities even before we
fully understand them. If an individual believes in certain higher
motivations they will also gradually start embodying them.

Providing belief-based pathways that enable individuals to go deeper within themselves
to expand their identities is integral to building an inclusive and expansive
culture. That is often how belief translates into knowing and why culture has
a huge impact on the mass populace.
We use this to align them with higher motivations beneath a culture.

Fostering group dynamics through events, workshops, and seminars is a great
way to enable individuals to strengthen their belief in higher motivations
into knowing. This also helps build a good culture by setting the stage for
the right kind of social dynamics.

## Evolved Humans for an Evolved Society

An evolved society needs equally aware and conscious individuals to
participate and build the society, define it's culture and drive it's economics.

People who have gone through a personal transformative **Journey of
Self-Discovery** and therefore **have Self-Love** can be the only individuals capable of
**Authentic Self-Expression** in **harmony with the collective** and in **service of the
collective** society.

*Personal and Emotional Development needs to be part of our incentive system
and external supportive services to be easily accessible.*

## Putting Things Together

To bring prosperity, the New Gaia State (NGS) aims to build a new culture and
a new economy "New Gaia Economy" that places emotional development at its core
and works on abundance. In doing so we:

1. Ensure each of NGCâ€™s member satisfy their own needs around growth and
   survival to feel fulfilled both economically and emotionally. The expansion
of an ecosystem should never come at the cost of oneâ€™s health and values.

1. Utilize Creative Economy as a framework to build new political economies
   that can measure and incentivize emotional development alongside material
progress.

1. Provide the necessary infrastructure (Technology, Economy, and Culture) for
   multiple sub-societies to emerge within NGS and operate on their
specialized domain of creative assets.
